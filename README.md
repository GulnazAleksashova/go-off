My learning projects.

There are 3 models shown here. The first model is emotions recognition by voice. The data for recognition was in the form of audio files recorded by the voices of 2 artists. They said 200 phrases with an intonation appropriate to each emotion. There were 7 emotions in total. In total, the database was 2800 records.

Model, *Aug_ VGG16_TEST*, is a cars classifier. It is supposed to recognize which of the three classes of cars is pictured in a photo. And at least 85% accuracy should be achieved on a validation set. The total number of data is 3427. I used here Transfering learning approach.

Model, called Authors, is a text recognision. The model is designed to work with text data. The task was to determine the author of the work by a fragment of the text.
